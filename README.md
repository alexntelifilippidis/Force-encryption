## 🚀 Overview

**Force-encryption** is a Python project that retrieves Star Wars character data from the SWAPI API, encrypts sensitive fields (like `birth_year`), and logs the results for further analysis. It demonstrates secure data handling and modern Python practices.

---

## ✨ Features

- Fetches data from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)
- Encrypts sensitive fields using a pluggable encryption utility
- Uses Python dataclasses for structured data
- Detailed logging for debugging and analytics
- Modular and extensible codebase
